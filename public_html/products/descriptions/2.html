<p>The Samsung Galaxy SIII i9300 (S3) Android Phone is the most exciting and state of the art Samsung phone yet! The S3 is absolutely world class and is set to be the hottest phone release this year. With a 4.8in Super AMOLED HD display and an 8-megapixel camera that captures 1080p HD video, this phone has it all.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S3 is, according to Samsung anyway, 'inspired by nature – it sees, listens, responds, and allows you to share the greatest moments’. The nature theme is evident when you touch the phone for the first time. It has brushed plastic and comes in “Pebble Blue” and “Marble White”. With a larger screen then the S2, but weighing less (133 grams) this phone is a must have!</p>
