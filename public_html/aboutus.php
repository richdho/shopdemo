<h2>About the developer</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Yuxiang He, or you can call me Richard, I am a recent graduate of University of Technology Sydney. In order to demonstrate what knowledge and skills I have, I built this demo website, you can either click “login” button on the top or sign up your own account. If you do not wish to give your personal information, I am fine with that, just use your fake email, but at least it “looks like” a real one, because the website will validate it.</p>
<h2>About this website</h2>
<p>Since this is a demo website, I am not selling anything to anyone. The back end data base will not record any information you input. For security and cost reasons, I do not integrate any payment function in this demo.</p>
<p>Here are some technical features of this website:</p>
    <p class="indent1">Design from scratch, no template.</p>
        <p class="indent2">From front end to back end, from database to user interface, I built it from scratch.  Actually, it is a good idea to use a template, but for the demonstration purpose, I would like to keep it as original as possible. As I am able to build it, it should not be difficult for me to make some changes in a template to fit in different requirements, which is the case in the industry.<br />
